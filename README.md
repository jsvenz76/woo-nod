<h1>Next Order Discount for WooCommerce</h1>

<h2>Welcome!</h2>

A customer ordering something from your shop for the first time is great. But how do you entice them back to buy more?

Next Order Discount (NOD) is an extension to the WooCommerce WordPress plugin that enables shop owners to attract further purchases from their customers automatically and without any need for manual intervention.

Following an initial order, NOD can be configured to schedule a customised follow up email to the customer tempting them to complete further purchases by offering a shop discount.

The coupons are automatically created within WooCommerce and can be included in the email content with the use of shortcodes.

Coupons can be fully customised within settings to determine rate of discount, expiry date, plus more...

* Choose a minimum spend policy
* Select whether or not to apply to free purchases
* Applies to first time orders only. Including guest checkouts.
* Specify the discount amount and whether it is applied as a percentage or a flat rate
* Customise how long after the purchase is completed that the offer is sent to the customer
* Specify how long the offer is valid for
* Exclude for individual products
* Customise the email subject, header and content
* NOD shortcodes
* Numerous hooks and filters for our developer friends
